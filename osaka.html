        <h3 id="title-main">History</h3>

        <p>In 1583 Toyotomi Hideyoshi commenced construction on the site of the Ikk≈ç-ikki temple of Ishiyama
            Hongan-ji.The basic plan was modeled after Azuchi Castle, the headquarters of Oda Nobunaga. Hideyoshi
            wanted to build a castle that mirrored Nobunaga's but surpassed it in every way.
            In 1597 construction was completed and Hideyoshi died the year after.
        </p>
        <p>In 1620, the new heir to the shogunate, Tokugawa Hidetada, began to reconstruct and re-arm Osaka Castle. He
            completely buried the Toyotomi version of the castle with the new castle.
            In 1843, after decades of neglect, the castle got much-needed repairs when the bakufu collected money from
            the people of the region to rebuild several of the turrets.
        </p>
        <p>Under the Meiji government, Osaka Castle became part of the Osaka Army Arsenal (Osaka Hohei Kosho)
            manufacturing guns, ammunition, and explosives for Japan's rapidly expanding Western-style military.
            During World War II, the arsenal became one of the largest military armories, employing 60,000 workers.[14]
            American bombing raids targeting the arsenal damaged the reconstructed main keep and, on August 14, 1945,
            destroyed 90% of the arsenal and killed 382 people working there.

            In 1995, Osaka's government approved yet another restoration project, with the intent of restoring the main
            keep to its Edo-era splendor. In 1997, restoration was completed. The keep is a concrete reproduction
            (including elevators) of the original and the interior is intended as a modern, functioning museum.
