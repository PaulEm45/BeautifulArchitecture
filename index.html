        <h3 id="title-main">History</h3>

        <br>

        <p>Originally designed in 1882 by Francisco de Paula del Villar, Antoni Gaudi took on the project in 1883, with
            the vision of creating a church for the future.
            In 1885 the Crypt was built and the first mass was held, by 1891 the work on the St. Barnabus nativity
            facade had begun.
            The work on the bell tower was the only tower that Gaudi would see finished in 1925, as he continued to work
            on the project until his death in 1926.</p>
        <br>

        <p>Only ten years later La Sagrada Famila was vandelised during the spanish civil war.
            Then in 1936 after recovering working material from Gaudi`s workshop the project was taken over by Francesc
            de Paula Quintana.</p>

        <p>The project in the subsequent years has passed along to many different architects all with one singular goal
            in mind...completion.</p>
