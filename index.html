    <h2>La Sagrada Famila</h2>

    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>Originally designed in 1882 by Francisco de Paula del Villar, Antoni Gaudi took on the project in 1883, with the vision of creating a church for the future.
        In 1885 the Crypt was built and the first mass was held, by 1891 the work on the St. Barnabus nativity facade had begun.
        The work on the bell tower was the only tower that Gaudi would see finished in 1925, as he continued to work on the project until his death in 1926.
