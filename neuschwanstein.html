        <h3 id="title-history">History</h3>

        <p>Neuschwanstein embodies both the contemporaneous architectural fashion known as castle Romanticism
            and King Ludwig II's enthusiasm for the operas of Richard Wagner. In the 19th century, many
            castles were constructed or reconstructed, often with significant changes, to make them more picturesque.

            The inspiration for the construction of Neuschwanstein came from two journeys that Ludwig took in 1867, one
            in May to the reconstructed Wartburg near Eisenach and another in July to the Château de Pierrefonds,
            which Eugène Viollet-le-Duc was transforming from a ruined castle into a historicist palace.

            The building design was drafted by the stage designer Christian Jank and realised by the architect Eduard
            Riedel.
        </p>

        <p>The foundation stone for the palace was laid on 5 September 1869; in 1872, its cellar was completed, and in
            1876, everything up to the first floor, the gatehouse being finished first. At the end of 1882, it was
            completed and fully furnished, allowing Ludwig to take provisional lodgings there and observe the ongoing
            construction work.In 1874, management of the civil works passed from Eduard Riedel to Georg von
            Dollmann.The topping out ceremony for the Palas was in 1880, and in 1884 the King moved in to the new
            building.

            Due to its secluded and strategically unimportant location, the palace survived the destruction of the two
            World Wars. Until 1944, it served as a depot for Nazi plunder that was taken from France by the Reichsleiter
            Rosenberg Institute for the Occupied TerritoriesIn April 1945, the SS considered blowing up the palace to
            prevent the building and the artwork it contained from falling to the enemy.

            between two numbers that equals approximately 1.618. Usually written as the Greek letter phi, it is strongly
