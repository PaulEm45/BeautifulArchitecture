<h1>Welcome to my readme<h1> 

<h2>The idea<h2>

<p>This website is to give the user a brief look into the world of architecture that uses the golden ratio, thus most buildings are older when this principle was used to its upmost. I decided to base the website around 4 buildings that i like, and we will dive into their history, golden ratio and attractions per year, my aim is to add images with text and a map function to give the user a location of the building. i may also incorperate a feedback form with validation. The footer will then contain links to the buildings offical webpage.<p>
