<h1>Welcome to my readme<h1> 

<h2>The idea<h2>

<p>This website is to give the user a brief look into the world of architecture that uses the golden ratio, thus most buildings are older when this principle was used to its upmost. I decided to base the website around 4 buildings that i like, and we will dive into their history, golden ratio and attractions per year, my aim is to add images with text and a map function to give the user a location of the building. i may also incorperate a feedback form with validation. The footer will then contain links to the buildings offical webpage.<p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Header</li>

    Within the header section i have tried to create a functional and responsive header that includes a 'checkbox' function. The header is to comprise of the site name (which will also be a home link) and 3 links to other pages. intinally this seemed to be working fine but i have ran into a few problems along the way when changing the header for responsive design.

    <li> Images</li>

    The images section have being giving me a headache especially when upscalling them to larger screens, i decided to use each pages image as a hero image and then overlay text, this way i can have a bolder description, whilst keeping the user engaged. this means that the title and brief history of the page is displayed on and around the main image when in each screen size, extra content will be added in the main section.

</ul>

<h2>Fixes</h2>

<ul>
    <li>I have being having some trouble with my code with links not working properly, i have now rectified this as the error was a keystroke error, i had put -blank insted of _blank and had also missed the / from the end of the url and that closed the html in the wrong place.... durning this part i also found out the quick comment shortcut of CTRL + / to turn any code into a comment.</li>
</ul>
