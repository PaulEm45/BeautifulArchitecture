<h1>Beautiful Architecture<h1> 

<h2>Purpose of the project<h2>

<p>This website is to give the user a brief look into the world of architecture that uses the golden ratio, thus most buildings are older when this principle was used to its upmost. I decided to base the website around 4 buildings that i like, and we will dive into their history, golden ratio and attractions per year, my aim is to add images with text and a map function to give the user a location of the building.<p>

<p>The user should be able to browse the website easily and find in informative, but the user is also able to give suggestions/reviews for the owner to look at.</p>

<h2>User Stories</h2>

<h3>The home page</h3>

<p>The first page will give the user a straight up insight into the rest of the pages, with a layout that will correspond to a recurring theme all the way through. The first page describes an iconic building that many will recognise, and give a brief history, ratio and visitor number also a location is included</p>

<h3>St.Pauls Page</h3>

<p>The second page is much like the first giving conformity to the site, detailing a breif history of the image displayed and its title.</p>

<h3>Osaka Page</h3>

<p>Again the third page will give the user the same information as the previous pages</p>

<h3>Neuschwanstein page</h3>

<p>The fourth page will agian look at the history, ratio and visitor numbers, including a map as the prious pages also did.</p>

<h3>Contact Us section</h3>

<p>Within the footer of the page a form is located through the contact us link, which gives the user a chance to suggest changes, or reviews/general feedback.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<h3>Header</h3>

<p>Within the header section i have tried to create a functional and responsive header that includes a navbar. The header is to comprise of the site name (which will also be a home link) and 3 links to other pages. The navbar is responsive when scaling to diffent screens and in the mobile and tablet view the navbar dissapears to give a clickable 'burger' icon. The colours on the header and navbar give a nice contrast that i have checked work both well in high light and low light. The header and navbar are visable on all pages of the site and stay at the top of the page when scrolling down.</p>

<h3>Main Content</h3>

<p>The content for each page is only slightly different on each page, in regards to the history of the buildings, each page has a title and a buzzword caption to lead the user in. All pages include a seperation location map for where the build is situated.</p>

<h3>Footer</h3>

<p>The footer diplays social media icons and also a 'contact us' link where the user is able to give a review or feedback that requires them to use an email address.</p>

<h3>Images</h3>

<p>The images section have being giving me a headache especially when upscalling them to larger screens, i decided to use each pages image as a hero image and then overlay text, this way i can have a bolder description, whilst keeping the user engaged. this means that the title and brief history of the page is displayed on and around the main image when in each screen size, extra content will be added in the main section.</p>

<h2>Future Features</h2>

<p>Future features i would hope to include would be a timer that shows how many people have visited the corresponding locations in the time the user has been on the page, i believe this would give the page extra interactivity. Also extra media links with more images and the potential to change the image of screen to the user defined colour pallete, eg. the user could paint the building whichever colour they would like.</p>

<h2>Typeography and Colour Scheme</h2>

<p>The original colour scheme was slightly brighter but when i passed the website through 'Lighthouse' it flagged some contrast issues. These have been changed to give extra accessability</p>

<h2>Wireframes</h2>

<p>I did not use wireframing in this website as i am from an architectural background and have trusted the pen and paper mock up however messy. This gives me an easy to refer to look even when not at the screen.</p>

<h2>Technology</h2>

<p>The technologies used in this website are HTML and CSS, that include Navbar Elements, sticky headers and media screen queries for a responsive design, i have also incorperated icons to make the interactivity more appeasing and aimiable. </p>

<h2>Testing</h2>

<h3>Code Validation</h3>

<p>HTML-No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator.</p>

<img>

<p>CSS-No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator</p>

<img>

<p>Devtools - Lighthouse</p>

<h3>Test Cases</h3>

<p>When i first ran the html through the W3C Validation a few error popped up mainly linked to grammer and missing/extra parts put into the code</p>

<h3>Fixed Bugs</h3>

<p>I have being having some trouble with my code with links not working properly, i have now rectified this as the error was a keystroke error, i had put -blank insted of _blank and had also missed the / from the end of the url and that closed the html in the wrong place.... durning this part i also found out the quick comment shortcut of CTRL + / to turn any code into a comment.</p>

<p>I have changed all the colour codes to hex to keep uniformity.</p>

<h3>Supported screens and browsers</h3>

<p>The website will run on all screen sizes, although there is one screen size at the lowest width that the burger icon is slightly cut off, this however does not limit any accessibility and the navbar dropdown works correctly.</p>

<p>Supported browsers - Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge, Samsung and Apple browers</p>

<h2>Deployment</h2>

<h3>Via Gitpod</h3>

<p>The site is available via https://paulem45-beautifularchi-757qa9u2rnk.ws-eu114.gitpod.io/</p>

<h3>Via Github pages</h3>

<p>The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
    1.In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
    2.From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
    3.Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
